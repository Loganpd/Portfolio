In this project, a data visualization with Tableau is presented in the form of an interactive dashboard.

The dataset used is the Superstore dataset that can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final

In this dataset, you can find the sales of different item and item-groups over time, across different states of the United States. The data has been analyzed in this project and the profit and the sales of the store for different item groups on every state are visualized. You can interact with the data visualization as you see fit, and extract the information that guides you in making informed business decisions. 

A sample image of the interactive data visualization can be found in this directory. To observe the dashboard itself and interact with it, I have published it in Tableau Public and you can reach it at the link below:

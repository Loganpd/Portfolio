## Introduction
This project is build on top of my personally curated dataset that can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pedramabdolahi/country-life-expectancy
<br/>

## Dataset description
The curated dataset consists of 1365 records and 19 columns
- Polio incidence: Total (reported) polio cases
- Tuberculosis incidence: Estimated rate of new tuberculosis cases per 100,000 people. This includes both new and latent reactivated infections.
- Tuberculosis deaths: Estimated mortality from all forms of tuberculosis per 100,000 population.
- Malaria deaths: The number of deaths from malaria per 100,000 people.
- Malaria incidence:  the number of new cases of malaria in a year per 1,000 population at risk.
- Alcohol deaths: Annual number of deaths from alcohol use disorders per 100,000 people.
- Smoking deaths: Deaths that are from all causes attributed to smoking per 100,000 people, in both sexes aged age-standardized
- Obesity deaths: Deaths that are from all causes attributed to high body-mass index per 100,000 people
- Cardiovascular disease deaths: Death rate due to Cardiovascular diseases per 100,000 people
- Cardiovascular disease incidence: Number of new cases of cardiovascular diseases per 100 people
- Deaths by suicide: Annual number of suicides per 100,000 people. Suicide deaths are underreported in many countries due to social stigma and cultural or legal concerns. This data is adjusted for this underreporting to estimate the actual rate of suicides.
- Deaths due to Cardiovascular diseases: Deaths due to cardiovascular diseases per 100,000 people.
- Mean years of schooling: Average number of years adults over 25 years participated in formal education.
- GDP: GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2017 international $)
- Gov health expenditure: Domestic general government health expenditure (GGHE-D) as percentage of general government expenditure (GGE) (%)
- Undernourishment: Share of individuals that have a daily food intake that is insufficient to provide the amount of dietary energy required to
maintain a normal, active, and healthy life.


## Objectives
In this project, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is carried out on the life expectancy of countries and patterns within the data are visualized. Moreover, the life expectancy of the countries can be predicted multiple years into the future.

# Project scenario
A Data Science Coding project working with a real-world dataset to build a prediction or classification model. Python and Jupyter Notebook are used to tackle the problem, focusing on data manipulation, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Summary
Predicting whether or not subscriptions on a video stream platform will churn. This can help platform managers assess current and future plans to keep and gain more viewers.

## Solution
This project was aimed at maximizing the are under the ROC curve (ROC AUC),  which shows the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes effectively. 
Through data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and modeling, it was possible to train a model that yields an ROC AUC of 75.07%. The yielded performance is better than 93% of all the models trained by other competitors in the challenge, thus, can help detect churn better.

## Approach
1. Understanding and loading the data (pandas library)
1. Preprocessing and encoding the data (pandas library)
1. Visualizing and analyzing the data (Tableau public)
1. Data modeling and model selection (Scikit-Learn library)
1. Model training and evaluation (Scikit-Learn library)
